# GLOSSARY — CCC Structural Folding Runtime (CSFR)

## Canonical Terms and Definitions

**CCC Structural Folding Runtime (CSFR)**
**From Metric-Space Objects to Runtime Localization**

---

# 1. Purpose

This glossary defines the core terms used throughout the CSFR repository.

The goal is to maintain stable meanings across:

* structural representation;
* metric organization;
* clustering;
* CCC folding;
* runtime dispatch;
* structural localization;
* CCC DNA;
* Two-Way CCC;
* Two-Phase structural search.

The most important distinctions are:

$$
Cluster
\neq
Cluster\ CCC
\neq
CCC\ DNA
$$

and:

$$
D_{PP}
\neq
D_{PC}
\neq
D_{CC}.
$$

---

# 2. CSFR

## CCC Structural Folding Runtime

**Abbreviation:** `CSFR`

A general structural runtime that transforms metric-space object collections into folded CCC structures that can support runtime search, dispatch, and localization.

Canonical pipeline:

$$
Objects
\rightarrow
Metric
\rightarrow
Cluster
\rightarrow
Structural\ Merge
\rightarrow
CCC
\rightarrow
Localization.
$$

Scalable form:

$$
CCC
\rightarrow
DNA
\rightarrow
Retrieve
\rightarrow
Verify
\rightarrow
Localization.
$$

Core question:

> **How does a set of metric-space objects become a folded CCC structure that can support runtime localization?**

---

# 3. CCC

## CCC

A reusable structural representation that preserves selected information needed for future comparison, navigation, dispatch, or reasoning.

Within CSFR, a CCC may represent:

```text
a cluster
a sequence position
a runtime node
a higher-level structural region
```

CCC is broader than any one specific data structure.

---

# 4. Cluster

## Cluster

A collection of objects grouped according to structural or metric similarity.

Formally:

$$
C =
\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_m\}.
$$

A cluster describes membership.

It does not automatically provide a runtime-ready representation.

Key distinction:

$$
\boxed{
Cluster
\neq
Runtime\ Structure
}
$$

---

# 5. Cluster CCC

## Cluster CCC

A folded CCC representation constructed from a cluster.

Formally:

$$
CCC_C =
Fold_\pi(C),
$$

where \(\pi\) is a structural merge and filtering policy.

For aligned sequences:

$$
CCC_C =
[P_0,P_1,\ldots,P_{n-1}].
$$

Each position may contain multiple weighted alternatives.

Key definition:

> **A Cluster CCC is a policy-compressed structural possibility set.**

---

# 6. Structural Folding

## Structural Folding

The process of compressing repeated or related structural observations into a reusable CCC representation.

Canonical transformation:

$$
Cluster
\rightarrow
Structural\ Merge
\rightarrow
Cluster\ CCC.
$$

Structural folding attempts to reduce redundancy without destroying the information required for future runtime localization.

---

# 7. Fold

## Fold

The result or operation of structural compression.

A fold may preserve:

```text
dominant structure
significant alternatives
selected uncertainty
position semantics
structural motifs
```

while discarding:

```text
low-support noise
redundant samples
unnecessary precision
```

---

# 8. Folding Policy

## Folding Policy

A policy controlling which structural information survives the folding process.

Possible parameters include:

```text
minimum weight
Top-N
cumulative coverage
minimum count
entropy threshold
numeric bucket policy
candidate cap
position-specific rules
```

Formally:

$$
CCC_C =
Fold_\pi(C).
$$

---

# 9. Structural Merge

## Structural Merge

The operation that combines multiple related structures into one CCC representation.

Structural merge is the transition between:

$$
Cluster
$$

and:

$$
Cluster\ CCC.
$$

The exact algorithm depends on structural type.

---

# 10. Claw-Dragon Merge

## Claw-Dragon Merge

A general structural merge problem in which many interacting substructures, branches, positions, or correspondence relationships must be merged into one reusable representation.

Typical difficulties include:

```text
different sequence lengths
uncertain alignment
branching
missing elements
local correspondence
structural alternatives
```

CSFR-003 focuses on an important simplified special case.

---

# 11. Aligned Sequence Merge

## Aligned Sequence Merge

A simplified Claw-Dragon Merge in which all sequences have:

$$
Equal\ Length
$$

and:

$$
Strict\ Positional\ Alignment.
$$

The general correspondence problem then reduces to:

$$
Per\text{-}Position\ Structural\ Merge.
$$

Canonical pipeline:

```text
Collect
→ Count
→ Weight
→ Normalize
→ Sort
→ Filter
→ Position CCC
→ Sequence CCC
```

---

# 12. Strict Positional Alignment

## Strict Positional Alignment

The assumption that the same sequence position has the same structural meaning across all sequences.

Formally:

$$
S_i[j]
\leftrightarrow
S_k[j].
$$

This assumption is what makes the aligned-sequence Claw-Dragon reduction possible.

---

# 13. Position CCC

## Position CCC

A CCC representing the structural possibilities at one aligned sequence position.

Example:

```text
Position 3

UP      0.55
DOWN    0.32
FLAT    0.13
```

Formally:

$$
P_j =
\{(v_1,w_1),(v_2,w_2),\ldots\}.
$$

---

# 14. Sequence Cluster CCC

## Sequence Cluster CCC

A Cluster CCC for aligned sequences.

Formally:

$$
CCC_C =
[P_0,P_1,\ldots,P_{n-1}],
$$

where each \(P_j\) is a Position CCC.

---

# 15. Structural Possibility Set

## Structural Possibility Set

A representation containing multiple structurally meaningful alternatives rather than one forced representative value.

Example:

```text
UP      0.51
DOWN    0.45
```

instead of:

```text
UP
```

This is one of the core semantics of Cluster CCC.

---

# 16. Centroid

## Centroid

A single representative point, commonly produced by averaging numeric cluster members.

For numeric vectors:

$$
\mu_j =
\frac{1}{m}
\sum_i x_{ij}.
$$

A centroid is not equivalent to a Cluster CCC.

Key distinction:

$$
\boxed{
Cluster\ CCC
\neq
Centroid
}
$$

---

# 17. Winner-Take-All

## Winner-Take-All

A policy that retains only the strongest candidate or lowest-distance target.

Abbreviation:

`WTA`

Example:

```text
UP      0.51
DOWN    0.45
```

becomes:

```text
UP
```

CSFR does not require WTA folding or WTA dispatch.

---

# 18. Core

## Structural Core

The stable or dominant portion of a CCC.

Example:

```text
UP 0.95
```

may be treated as Core.

Core often provides strong identity and retrieval evidence.

---

# 19. Delta

## Structural Delta

Meaningful structural variation retained around the Core.

Example:

```text
UP      0.52
DOWN    0.44
```

contains a dominant state plus substantial alternative structure.

A useful interpretation is:

$$
CCC =
Core
+
\Delta.
$$

---

# 20. Uncertainty-Preserving Folding

## Uncertainty-Preserving Folding

A fold that preserves selected structural ambiguity or multimodality rather than collapsing all variation into one value.

Example:

$$
\{UP:0.52,DOWN:0.44\}
$$

may be retained instead of only:

$$
UP.
$$

CSFR supports this as a policy-controlled behavior.

---

# 21. Structural Representation

## Structural Representation

The typed representation of an object before metric comparison.

Possible measure types include:

```text
Named Double
Named String
Named Double Sequence
Named String Sequence
Derived Structural Feature
```

The representation should preserve structural semantics before metric aggregation.

---

# 22. Generic Structural Container

## Generic Structural Container

A heterogeneous carrier capable of storing multiple named structural measure types within one object.

A `GenericContainerStarmap`-style representation is one example.

Typical contents:

```text
numeric attributes
categorical attributes
numeric sequences
categorical sequences
derived motifs
```

---

# 23. GenericContainerStarmap

## GenericContainerStarmap

A generic structural representation concept used for combining multiple named value and sequence types within one metric framework.

Within CSFR it can act as the object representation layer before \(D_{PP}\) or \(D_{PC}\) computation.

---

# 24. Metric Space

## Metric Space

A space in which objects are organized according to a defined distance or similarity function.

Within CSFR, metric space is primarily used before folding for:

```text
nearest-pair discovery
clustering
candidate K estimation
structural organization
```

---

# 25. Composite Structural Distance

## Composite Structural Distance

A distance constructed from multiple local structural distance channels.

Canonical form:

$$
D(x,y) =
\sum_r w_rD_r(x,y).
$$

Channels may include:

```text
numeric
categorical
point sequence
bigram
trigram
reverse sequence
domain-specific motifs
```

---

# 26. Structural Similarity

## Structural Similarity

A normalized similarity measure between two structural objects or representations.

Typical range:

$$
Sim(x,y)\in[0,1].
$$

A common conversion is:

$$
D(x,y) =
1-Sim(x,y).
$$

---

# 27. Scoring Tree

## Composite Structural Scoring Tree

A hierarchical metric aggregation structure in which local metric channels are organized into weighted subtrees.

Example:

```text
Total Similarity
├── Scalar Features
├── Sequence Features
└── Domain Features
```

The tree improves auditability and policy control.

---

# 28. D_PP

## Object-to-Object Distance

**Notation:**

$$
D_{PP}
$$

Relationship:

$$
Object
\leftrightarrow
Object.
$$

Primary uses:

```text
nearest-pair analysis
clustering
metric-space organization
candidate K estimation
```

Mnemonic:

> **D_PP discovers structure.**

---

# 29. D_PC

## Object-to-CCC Distance

**Notation:**

$$
D_{PC}
$$

Relationship:

$$
Object
\leftrightarrow
Cluster\ CCC.

runtime dispatch
candidate verification
structural localization
leaf selection
```

Mnemonic:

D_{CC}
$$

Relationship:

$$
CCC
\leftrightarrow
CCC.
$$

Potential uses:

```text

CCC split analysis
structural evolution
cluster refinement
```

Mnemonic:

> **D_CC organizes and evolves CCC space.**

---

# 31. Metric Triad

## CSFR Metric Triad

The three canonical CSFR metric relationships:

$$
\boxed{
D_{PP},
D_{PC},
D_{CC}
}
$$

Compact interpretation:

```text
D_PP → Discover

D_PC → Localize

D_CC → Organize / Evolve
```

---

# 32. Value-to-Value Distance

## Value-to-Value Distance

A local metric comparing one concrete value with another.

Example:

$$
d(UP,DOWN).
$$

This is typical inside \(D_{PP}\).

---

# 33. Value-to-Possibility-Set Distance

## Value-to-Possibility-Set Distance

A local metric comparing one concrete target value with a weighted CCC candidate set.

Example:

$$
UP
\leftrightarrow
\{UP:0.6,FLAT:0.3,DOWN:0.1\}.
$$

This is typical inside \(D_{PC}\).

---

# 34. Weighted Consensus Distance

## Weighted Consensus Distance

A canonical value-to-CCC distance defined as:

$$
d_j(x_j,P_j) =
\sum_v p(v)d(x_j,v).
$$

It respects both:

```text
candidate distance
candidate support
```

and is a natural default for \(D_{PC}\).

---

# 35. Position Weight

## Position Weight

A weight controlling the importance of one sequence position in the total metric.

Notation:

$$
w_j.
$$

Example:

```text
early context      0.5
middle formation   1.0
recent trigger     1.8
```

---

# 36. Dimension Weight

## Dimension Weight

A weight controlling the contribution of one structural feature family.

Examples:

```text
trend
volume
volatility
valuation
sequence shape
```

---

# 37. Feature Weight

## Feature Weight

A weight controlling the contribution of a derived feature channel such as:

```text
point match
bigram
trigram
reverse n-gram
motif
```

---

# 38. Bucketing

## Numeric Bucketing

The transformation of a continuous numeric value into a structural category.

Example:

$$
23.12
\rightarrow
MEDIUM\_HIGH.
$$

Interpretation:

$$
Continuous\ Metric\ Space
\rightarrow
Structural\ Symbol\ Space.
$$

Within CSFR, bucketing can be viewed as a micro-folding operation.

---

# 39. Structural Resolution

## Structural Resolution

The level of detail at which structural differences are represented or compared.

Resolution can be controlled through:

```text
bucket width
n-gram length
position weighting
feature inclusion
motif granularity
CCC filtering threshold
```

Structural resolution is a policy surface rather than a single scalar.

---

# 40. Bigram

## Bigram

A two-element local sequence motif.

For:

```text
UP, UP, DOWN
```

the bigrams are:

```text
UP→UP
UP→DOWN
```

Bigrams encode local transition structure.

---

# 41. Trigram

## Trigram

A three-element local sequence motif.

Example:

```text
UP→UP→DOWN
```

Trigrams preserve more local context than bigrams.

---

# 42. N-Gram

## N-Gram

A contiguous sequence motif of length \(n\).

N-gram length acts as a structural-resolution parameter.

General tradeoff:

$$
Higher\ n
\rightarrow
Higher\ Specificity
$$

but also:

$$
Higher\ n
\rightarrow
Higher\ Sparsity.
$$

---

# 43. Forward N-Gram

## Forward N-Gram

An n-gram preserving the natural sequence direction.

Example:

```text
UP→DOWN
```

Forward and reverse n-grams should normally remain distinct when temporal direction matters.

---

# 44. Reverse N-Gram

## Reverse N-Gram

An n-gram constructed from the reverse direction of a sequence.

Used as an additional structural retrieval or comparison channel.

It should not be mixed indiscriminately with forward n-grams.

---

# 45. Structural Motif

## Structural Motif

A reusable local or higher-level pattern extracted from an object's structure.

Examples:

```text
breakout
reversal
UP→UP→DOWN
high-volatility transition
software call pattern
sensor anomaly sequence
```

Motifs may participate in both metric scoring and CCC DNA.

---

# 46. Metric Policy

## Metric Policy

A configuration defining how structural distance is calculated.

Possible components:

```text
feature schema
normalization
bucket rules
weights
n-gram settings
missing-value handling
aggregation
confidence rules
```

Metric policy should be explicit and versioned.

---

# 47. Metric Signature

## Metric Signature

A reproducible description of the metric configuration used to create or compare structures.

May include:

```text
dimensions
normalizers
bucket schemas
n-gram settings
weights
aggregation rules
version
```

---

# 48. Structural Localization

## Structural Localization

The process of mapping an incoming object into a folded CCC hierarchy or CCC candidate space.

Canonical hierarchical form:

$$
x
\rightarrow
N_0
\rightarrow
N_1
\rightarrow
\cdots
\rightarrow
N_L.
$$

Definition:

> **Structural Localization identifies where an incoming object belongs in the folded structural space.**

---

# 49. Localization Path

## Localization Path

The ordered sequence of runtime nodes traversed during structural localization.

Example:

```text
ROOT
↓
HIGH_VOLATILITY
↓
UPTREND
↓
LATE_FORMATION
↓
LEAF-037
```

The path itself can provide interpretable structural context.

---

# 50. Runtime Node

## Runtime Node

A dispatchable structural unit in a CCC hierarchy.

A runtime node may contain:

```text
CCC
metric policy
dispatch policy
metadata
Per-Node Intelligence
```

---

# 51. Leaf

## Structural Leaf

A terminal or sufficiently localized runtime node.

A leaf may contain:

```text
Cluster CCC
historical support
outcome distributions
local model
local policy
version metadata
```

A leaf is not merely an ID.

---

# 52. Runtime Dispatch

## Runtime Dispatch

The process of selecting one or more next CCC nodes based on object-to-CCC comparison and policy.

Canonical form:

$$
Child(x) =
Policy(
D_{PC}(x,CCC_1),
\ldots,
D_{PC}(x,CCC_k)
).
$$

---

# 53. Dispatch Policy

## Dispatch Policy

A policy controlling how candidate CCC distances are converted into runtime routing.

Possible forms:

```text
Top-1
Top-N
threshold
margin-aware
beam search
fallback
UNKNOWN
```

Dispatch is intentionally more general than argmin.

---

# 54. Top-1 Dispatch

## Top-1 Dispatch

A policy selecting the candidate with minimum distance.

$$
Child(x) =
\arg\min_i D_{PC}(x,CCC_i).
$$

Simple but potentially overconfident near structural boundaries.

---

# 55. Top-N Dispatch

## Top-N Dispatch

A policy preserving several leading candidate CCCs.

Useful for:

```text
ambiguity
beam search
boundary cases
Two-Phase verification
```

---

# 56. Dispatch Margin

## Dispatch Margin

The difference between the best and second-best candidate distance.

If:

$$
d_1\leq d_2,
$$

then:

$$
M=d_2-d_1.
$$

Small margin suggests structural ambiguity.

---

# 57. Structural Boundary

## Structural Boundary

A region in which two or more CCC candidates have similarly strong structural compatibility with an incoming object.

Boundary cases may trigger:

```text
Top-N routing
extra verification
fallback
specialized Per-Node Intelligence
```

---

# 58. UNKNOWN

## UNKNOWN

A first-class runtime result indicating that no existing CCC is sufficiently compatible with the incoming object.

Example condition:

$$
\min_iD_{PC}(x,CCC_i) >
\tau_{accept}.
$$

Possible meanings:

```text
novel structure
distribution shift
new regime
insufficient historical coverage
bad or incompatible input
```

UNKNOWN is not equivalent to low confidence.

---

# 59. Low Confidence

## Low Confidence

A condition where an object matches existing CCCs sufficiently well but the winner is ambiguous or poorly separated.

Typical case:

$$
d_1\leq\tau_{accept}
$$

but:

$$
d_2-d_1
$$

is small.

---

# 60. Fallback

## Fallback

A runtime policy that moves to a broader or safer structural context when fine-grained localization fails.

Example:

```text
fine leaf fails
↓
parent regime
↓
broader Per-Node Intelligence
```

---

# 61. Beam Search

## Structural Beam Search

A localization strategy that preserves multiple candidate paths across levels of a CCC hierarchy.

Useful for avoiding irreversible early misrouting.

---

# 62. Per-Node Intelligence

## Per-Node Intelligence

Specialized intelligence attached to a localized runtime node.

Examples:

```text
local model
local statistics
local rules
local agent
historical outcome distribution
local decision policy
```

Architecture:

$$
Localization
+
Per\text{-}Node\ Intelligence.
$$

---

# 63. Localization Before Prediction

## Localization Before Prediction

The principle that structural context should be identified before application-specific prediction or decision when local structure matters.

Canonical flow:

$$
Object
\rightarrow
StructuralLocalization
\rightarrow
LocalIntelligence
\rightarrow
Prediction/Decision.
$$

---

# 64. CCC DNA

## CCC DNA

A compact, policy-selected structural signature extracted from a CCC for retrieval and indexing.

Examples:

```text
ATTR:VOLATILITY:HIGH
POS:0:UP
F2:UP→DOWN
F3:UP→UP→DOWN
```

Formally:

$$
DNA(CCC) =
\{f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_m\}.
$$

---

# 65. CCC DNA vs CCC

## CCC DNA vs Full CCC

Key distinction:

$$
\boxed{
DNA(CCC)
\neq
CCC
}
$$

CCC DNA is a retrieval handle.

The full CCC remains the authoritative structural representation used for final metric verification.

---

# 66. Core DNA

## Core DNA

DNA extracted from highly stable or dominant CCC structure.

Core DNA is usually:

```text
high-confidence
compact
discriminative
```

and suitable for fast first-stage retrieval.

---

# 67. Delta DNA

## Delta DNA

DNA extracted from meaningful retained alternatives or structural variation.

Delta DNA can broaden retrieval when Core DNA is too restrictive.

---

# 68. Reverse Index

## Reverse Structural Index

An index mapping structural DNA features to candidate CCCs.

Canonical form:

$$
Feature
\rightarrow
Candidate\ CCCs.
$$

Example:

```text
F3:UP→UP→DOWN
→ CCC-017
→ CCC-037
```

---

# 69. Inverted Index

## Inverted Index

A standard indexing structure mapping tokens to objects containing those tokens.

CSFR adapts the idea from:

```text
word → documents
```

to:

```text
structural token → CCCs.
```

---

# 70. Query DNA

## Query DNA

The structural signature extracted from an incoming object for reverse CCC retrieval.

Formally:

$$
DNA(x).
$$

Query DNA and CCC DNA should use compatible token schemas.

---

# 71. Candidate CCC

## Candidate CCC

A CCC selected by a cheap first-stage retrieval mechanism for later full metric verification.

Candidate status does not imply final localization.

---

# 72. Candidate Retrieval

## Candidate Retrieval

The process of using query DNA, index matches, or other cheap structural evidence to construct a reduced set of CCCs for verification.

---

# 73. Candidate Recall

## Candidate Recall

The probability that the true best CCC under full metric comparison is included in the Phase-1 candidate set.

If \(CCC^*\) is the best full-metric candidate:

$$
Recall_K =
P(CCC^*\in TopK_{retrieval}).
$$

High candidate recall is critical for Two-Phase search.

---

# 74. Candidate Reduction Ratio

## Candidate Reduction Ratio

The fraction of total CCCs eliminated before full metric verification.

If total CCC count is \(N\) and candidate count is \(K\):

$$
ReductionRatio =
1-\frac{K}{N}.
$$

---

# 75. Two-Way CCC

## Two-Way CCC

A runtime architecture combining two structural access directions.

Forward:

$$
Object
\rightarrow
D_{PC}
\rightarrow
CCC.
$$

Reverse:

$$
Object\ DNA
\rightarrow
Reverse\ Index
\rightarrow
Candidate\ CCCs.
$$

Together they provide both metric and structural retrieval access.

---

# 76. Forward Dispatch

## Forward Dispatch

The direct object-to-CCC path based on full or hierarchical \(D_{PC}\) evaluation.

---

# 77. Reverse Structural Access

## Reverse Structural Access

The path from observed structural evidence to candidate CCCs through CCC DNA and reverse indexing.

---

# 78. Two-Phase Structural Search

## Two-Phase Structural Search

A search architecture separating cheap candidate retrieval from expensive metric verification.

### Phase 1

$$
DNA
\rightarrow
Candidate\ CCCs.
$$

### Phase 2

$$
Candidate\ CCCs
\rightarrow
D_{PC}
\rightarrow
Localization.
$$

Core principle:

$$
\boxed{
Retrieve\ First,
Verify\ Second
}
$$

---

# 79. Structural Retrieval

## Structural Retrieval

The low-cost retrieval of CCC candidates based on explicit structural features rather than complete metric evaluation.

Typical mechanisms:

```text
DNA tokens
reverse index
weighted voting
rarity weighting
position-aware motifs
```

---

# 80. Metric Verification

## Metric Verification

The full \(D_{PC}\) evaluation performed after candidate retrieval.

Metric verification remains authoritative for final structural localization.

---

# 81. Direct Structural Jumping

## Direct Structural Jumping

A runtime optimization in which strong DNA evidence retrieves a small set of deep nodes or leaves directly, bypassing much of the hierarchical dispatch tree.

---

# 82. Direct-Leaf Jumping

## Direct-Leaf Jumping

A special case of direct structural jumping where query DNA retrieves one or several leaf CCCs directly for full \(D_{PC}\) verification.

---

# 83. Cross-Branch Recovery

## Cross-Branch Recovery

The use of reverse structural retrieval to recover candidate CCCs outside a branch selected by hierarchical metric dispatch.

This reduces the risk of irreversible early tree misrouting.

---

# 84. Structural Search Plane

## Structural Search Plane

The overall runtime layer responsible for navigating CCC structures.

CSFR may use two complementary planes:

```text
Metric Navigation Plane
Structural Retrieval Plane
```

---

# 85. Metric Navigation Plane

## Metric Navigation Plane

A CCC-tree navigation mechanism based primarily on hierarchical \(D_{PC}\) evaluation.

---

# 86. Structural Retrieval Plane

## Structural Retrieval Plane

A reverse-indexed search mechanism based on CCC DNA and explicit structural tokens.

---

# 87. DNA Namespace

## DNA Namespace

A token prefix or schema identifying the structural type of a DNA feature.

Examples:

```text
ATTR:
POS:
F2:
F3:
R2:
R3:
```

Namespaces prevent semantically different features from colliding.

---

# 88. Position-Aware DNA

## Position-Aware DNA

A DNA token that retains sequence position.

Example:

```text
POS:3:UP
```

or:

```text
F2@3:UP→DOWN
```

Position-aware DNA improves discrimination but may increase sparsity.

---

# 89. Structural TF-IDF

## Structural TF-IDF

A retrieval weighting idea that gives higher importance to rare structural DNA features and lower importance to very common ones.

Example inverse-frequency term:

$$
IDF(f) =
\log
\frac{N}{1+df(f)}.
$$

This is analogous to textual TF-IDF but applied to explicit structural tokens.

---

# 90. DNA Density

## DNA Density

The number of DNA features emitted by one CCC.

$$
Density(CCC) =
|DNA(CCC)|.
$$

Too-dense DNA can cause noisy retrieval.

Too-sparse DNA can reduce recall.

---

# 91. Progressive Retrieval

## Progressive Retrieval

A search strategy that begins with coarse or high-value DNA features and adds finer features only if candidate reduction is insufficient.

Example:

```text
Scalar DNA
→ Position DNA
→ Bigrams
→ Trigrams
→ Rare Motifs
```

---

# 92. Search Budget

## Search Budget

A runtime policy controlling the amount of computation available for retrieval and verification.

It may govern:

```text
candidate count
number of DNA channels
tree depth
beam width
Phase-2 D_PC evaluations
```

---

# 93. Structural Compilation

## Structural Compilation

An interpretation of the CSFR offline process as compiling historical structural experience into executable runtime representations.

Analogy:

```text
Raw Objects          → source material
Clustering           → organization
CCC Merge            → compilation
CCC Tree / DNA Index → executable structural index
Localization         → runtime execution
```

---

# 94. Structural Runtime

## Structural Runtime

An execution environment in which incoming objects are compared, retrieved, dispatched, and localized against previously folded structural knowledge.

CSFR is one such runtime architecture.

---

# 95. Runtime-Ready Structure

## Runtime-Ready Structure

A structural representation that can directly participate in operational comparison, dispatch, search, or localization.

A raw cluster is not necessarily runtime-ready.

A Cluster CCC with compatible \(D_{PC}\) is.

---

# 96. Structural Provenance

## Structural Provenance

Metadata recording how a structural artifact was produced.

May include:

```text
source cluster
sample count
metric version
folding policy
CCC version
DNA policy
creation time
update time
```

---

# 97. CCC Version

## CCC Version

An identifier describing a specific state of a CCC.

CCC versioning is important because CCCs may:

```text
grow
split
merge
decay
be refolded
```

---

# 98. DNA Policy Version

## DNA Policy Version

An identifier describing the extraction rules used to produce CCC DNA.

It should remain compatible with query-DNA generation and reverse-index semantics.

---

# 99. Structural Evolution

## Structural Evolution

The process by which the CCC runtime changes over time.

Possible operations include:

```text
new CCC creation
CCC split
CCC merge
CCC decay
CCC reweighting
CCC refolding
tree growth
DNA reindexing
```

---

# 100. CCC Split

## CCC Split

The division of one structurally heterogeneous CCC or node into multiple more coherent CCCs.

Potential triggers:

```text
high entropy
poor localization quality
frequent ambiguity
hidden subclusters
```

---

# 101. CCC Merge

## CCC Merge

The combination of two structurally redundant or highly compatible CCCs into one structure.

Potential evidence includes:

$$
D_{CC}(CCC_A,CCC_B)
\approx 0.
$$

---

# 102. Structural Novelty

## Structural Novelty

An incoming structural pattern that is insufficiently represented by existing CCCs.

Structural novelty often appears through:

```text
UNKNOWN
low DNA retrieval quality
large D_PC
repeated unmatched patterns
```

---

# 103. Continual Structural Growth

## Continual Structural Growth

The process by which repeated novel observations generate new folded structures.

Example:

```text
UNKNOWN Objects
      ↓
Clustering
      ↓
New CCC
      ↓
New DNA
      ↓
New Runtime Node
```

---

# 104. Runtime Feedback

## Runtime Feedback

Operational signals from localization that inform offline restructuring.

Examples:

```text
frequent UNKNOWN
high ambiguity
poor CCC coherence
overloaded leaves
unstable dispatch
```

These signals can trigger refolding or tree growth.

---

# 105. Structural Coherence

## Structural Coherence

The degree to which members of a cluster or node are well represented by its CCC.

A possible diagnostic is:

$$
\frac{1}{|C|}
\sum_{x\in C}
D_{PC}(x,CCC_C).
$$

Lower average distance generally indicates stronger coherence.

---

# 106. CCC Entropy

## CCC Entropy

A measure of uncertainty within a Position CCC.

For:

$$
P_j =
\{p_1,\ldots,p_k\},
$$

entropy is:

$$
H(P_j) =
-\sum_i
p_i\log p_i.
$$

Low entropy suggests strong structural consensus.

High entropy suggests ambiguity.

---

# 107. Fold Quality

## Fold Quality

The quality of a Cluster CCC as a compressed structural representation.

Possible evaluation criteria:

```text
compactness
retained probability mass
structural coherence
dispatch stability
localization quality
uncertainty retention
runtime cost
```

---

# 108. Runtime-Oriented Clustering

## Runtime-Oriented Clustering

The principle that clustering should be evaluated partly by the quality of the runtime structures it produces.

Possible criteria:

```text
CCC stability
dispatch stability
UNKNOWN behavior
leaf coherence
Per-Node Intelligence quality
runtime cost
```

Thus the best \(K\) is not necessarily the one maximizing only a conventional clustering score.

---

# 109. K Discovery

## K Discovery

The process of estimating an appropriate number of metric clusters.

Possible evidence includes:

```text
nearest-pair merge progression
distance elbow
CCC stability
downstream dispatch quality
```

---

# 110. Nearest-Pair Merge

## Nearest-Pair Merge

A structural discovery process that repeatedly identifies or merges nearest objects or groups.

In CSFR it may help estimate candidate cluster count \(K\) or identify structural boundaries.

---

# 111. SMSF

## Stock-Market Structural Folding

**Abbreviation:** `SMSF`

A canonical application of CSFR to historical stock-market pattern spaces.

SMSF focuses on:

```text
market-pattern representation
historical structural regimes
current-pattern localization
local outcome intelligence
```

Key distinction:

$$
\boxed{
SMSF = Application
}
$$

$$
\boxed{
CSFR = Runtime\ Infrastructure
}
$$

---

# 112. Stock-Regime CCC

## Stock-Regime CCC

A Cluster CCC representing a historical stock-market structural regime.

It may contain:

```text
aligned sequence possibility sets
bucketed numeric states
market attributes
trajectory motifs
CCC DNA
historical support
```

---

# 113. Historical Structural Regime

## Historical Structural Regime

A region of historical object space characterized by recurring structural similarity.

In SMSF, a regime is a structural localization target rather than automatically a prediction class.

---

# 114. Structural Localization vs Prediction

## Structural Localization vs Prediction

Structural localization answers:

> Where does the current object belong structurally?

Prediction answers:

> What is likely to happen next?

These are separate operations.

Canonical chain:

$$
Object
\rightarrow
Localization
\rightarrow
HistoricalOutcomeSpace
\rightarrow
Prediction/Decision.
$$

---

# 115. Structural Stability

## Structural Stability

The persistence of a recognizable CCC structure over time.

Structural stability does not imply that downstream outcomes remain stable.

---

# 116. Outcome Stability

## Outcome Stability

The persistence of downstream behavior or outcome distributions associated with a localized structural regime.

Important distinction:

$$
\boxed{
Structural\ Stability
\neq
Outcome\ Stability
}
$$

# 120. Five Core Distinctions

The most important terminology boundaries in CSFR are:

### 1.

$$
Cluster
\neq
Cluster\ CCC.
$$

A cluster is membership.

A Cluster CCC is a folded runtime representation.

### 2.

$$
Cluster\ CCC
\neq
Centroid.
$$

A CCC may preserve multiple significant alternatives.

### 3.

$$
D_{PP}
\neq
D_{PC}
\neq
D_{CC}.
$$

The three metrics serve different structural roles.

### 4.

$$
CCC\ DNA
\neq
CCC.
$$

DNA retrieves.

CCC verifies.

### 5.

$$
Localization
\neq
Prediction.
$$

Localization identifies structural context.

Prediction or decision is downstream intelligence.

The central CSFR vocabulary can therefore be summarized as:

$$
\boxed{

\rightarrow
Localization
}
$$

with:

$$
\boxed{
D_{PP}

$$

providing the metric interfaces and:

$$
\boxed{
CCC\ DNA
}
$$

providing the reverse structural retrieval interface.
